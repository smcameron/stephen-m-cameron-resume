<b>Work Experience:</b><br>
<p><b>April 1997 - September 2014 (17 years): </b> Hewlett Packard (originally Compaq Computer Corporation) Houston, TX -- Senior Systems Software Engineer<br>
<p>Since about 2002, I have worked on the
linux storage drivers for HP's Smart Array line of RAID controllers, first the
&quot;cciss&quot; driver for which I added support for SCSI tape drives, and
later the current &quot;hpsa&quot; driver. I am the primary author of the hpsa
driver. I also worked on a SCSI-over-PCIE driver for about a year in
collaboration with SanDisk which I presented at the 2013 Linux Storage
Filesystem and Memory Management Summit. (See:
<a href="https://github.com/HPSmartStorage/scsi-over-pcie">https://github.com/HPSmartStorage/scsi-over-pcie</a>)</p>

<p>Most recently I have been working on enhancements to the hpsa driver to use
the new SCSI multiqueue enhancements and remove all the locks from the main i/o
path to enable performance of nearly 1 million IOPS on a single controller to a
single logical drive. I have been invited to the Linux Storage Filesystem and
Memory Management Summit for the last two years (2013, 2014). Some of my linux
kernel commits may be found here:
<a href="https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/log/?qt=author&amp;q=scameron">https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/log/?qt=author&amp;q=scameron</a></p>

<p>Additionally I worked on various Smart Array related storage utilities such
as SNMP agents, array configuration utilities, smartmontools, and various other
small utility programs.</p>

<p>In 2000, I worked on a driver for Smart Array RAID controllers for about a
year for IBM's and SCO's Project Monterey, which was a unix derivative of SCO
Unixware and IBM's AIX that was supposed to run on IBM POWER, PowerPC, IA64 and
IA32 processors. Project Monterey didn't really go anywhere though, as linux
kind of came along and ate its lunch.</p>

<p>From April 1997 to September 1998, I was responsible for supporting SCO
Openserver on Compaq's &quot;SmartStart&quot; CD. The SmartStart CD contained a
number of system specific drivers, most importantly storage drivers, and a
modified version of SCO's install media to enable injecting those drivers
during the install process.</p>

<p>During that time (1997-1998) I was also the system administrator for one of
Compaq's source code servers, which contained all the source for the drivers
and utilities that made up Compaq's drivers and software for SCO Openserver,
Unixware 2, and Unixware 7. That entailed the usual backups, user
administration, etc. Also, I set up and initiated the CVS source code control
system then in use. Prior to my arrival they were using just RCS.</p>

<p>I also automated the build process, and incidentally this was how I got into
driver development. Floppy diskette images needed to be created and Unixware
lacked any block loop device, so I wrote a driver for one to avoid the time
consuming and medium-error prone use of actual floppy diskettes.</p>

<b><p>July 1992 - April 1997 (5 years):</b> McDonnell Douglas Corporation (now Boeing) 16055 Space Center Blvd, Houston TX, 77062-6208 -- Unix Systems Administrator/Programmer</p>

<p>Since April 1995 I was the primary system administrator for a network of
approximately 60 Sun workstations (Sparc 5s, Sparc 20s, an Enterprise 3000 and
an Enterprise 5000) running SunOS 4.x or Solaris 2.x and 3 HP-9000s running
HP-UX 9.x. My responsibilities included hardware installation, OS installation,
software installation, licensing and configuration management, backups, user
account administration, network administration, and general troubleshooting to
name a few. Probably the most impressive thing I did in the Sys Admin vein was
a very elaborate NIS/amd automounter setup. Seeing as how this was 1995, and
mostly SunOS/Solaris, you might say I was a &quot;classically trained
sysadmin&quot;.</p>

<p>Prior to taking on system administration duties I worked as an
Ada/C/X/Motif/SQL programmer and my responsibilities included design,
implementation, testing and documentation of an Ada interface to an Oracle
database and VMS file system and various programs which used the interface. In
a related project, I was responsible for porting a portion of a real-time
simulation control program written in Ada from a VAX ELN environment to a DEC
Alpha/OSF/1 (later Compaq Alpha/Tru64 Unix) environment. This involved writing
Ada interfaces to many Unix system calls such as those dealing with semaphores,
message queues, and signals to name a few.</p>

<p><b>May 1989 - Jan 1992</b> (during summers and Christmas break from school)
Advanced Computing Solutions, Inc. (ACSI, later RealData, probably no longer
exists.) Houston, TX Data Systems Engineer</p>

<p>My responsibilities included design, coding, and testing of various programs
and components of ACSI's (pre-WWW) on-line real estate information service
(Oracle based), including programs to estimate adjustments to real estate
property values, programs to efficiently search large volumes of data (for
instance, all the property tax records for Harris County TX, numbered in the
millions (remember, this is circa 1989 when &quot;millions&quot; was a big
number) and generate reports in ASCII, PostScript, and troff formats. In
addition I worked on ACSI's Commercial Multiple Listings Service (CMLS) and the
billing system for the CMLS. I also worked on the redesign and conversion of a
nationwide security alarm monitoring system from COBOL to C. This involved
writing several cooperating C programs which communicated with each other in
nearly every way possible, via sockets, shared memory, semaphores, message
queues and FIFOs. All that work was done on a combination of HW, Suns, Data
Generals, Masscomps and some AT&amp;T 386 boxes running some beta release of
SVR4. Languages/Software used included C, Pro<em>C, Bourne shell, C shell,
SQL</em>plus, SQL<em>report, SQL</em>Forms (version 2.0 --gasp!) awk, and
troff. This work was all done during summer and Christmas breaks between
semesters while attending Texas A &amp; M. (total: 14.5 months)</p>

<p><b>Jan 1987 - Jan 1989</b> Mitre Corp. Nassau Bay, TX -- Technical Aide</p>

<p>My responsibilities at Mitre included adding a sophisticated (for its time)
user interface to a queueing analysis program written in Turbo Pascal on a DOS
machine. The interface included pull-down menus, windows and a spreadsheet-like
data entry module. I also extended the analysis portion of the program by
adding two new types of queues. I was also responsible for conversion of a
Space Station requirements database prototype from DBase III to Oracle. This
involved teaching myself to be my own Oracle DBA, teaching myself C, and
integrating the emacs editor into my application. I also created a C program
(the 2nd I ever wrote, after &quot;hello, world!&quot; of course) to read raw
DBase III files and produce output in a form importable by Oracle (SQL
&quot;insert&quot; statements and SQL*plus &quot;create table&quot; statements)
This work was done during summer and Christmas breaks between semesters while
attending Texas A &amp; M.</p>

Occasionally I teach a 2-day &quot;Intro to C
programming&quot; course and a 2-day &quot;Intro to Linux Device Driver
programming&quot; course there.</p>

<p>I'm also currently working on an open source (GPL) multiplayer networked 3D
starship bridge simulator called &quot;Space Nerds In Space&quot; in my spare
time. <a href="http://smcameron.github.io/space-nerds-in-space/">http://smcameron.github.io/space-nerds-in-space/</a></p>

<p>I built a cyclekart, which is a little car that's part way between a go-kart
and and an art project.<br>

<p>In 2007 or so, I wrote a video game similar to the old arcade game Defender
with a &quot;vi vs. Emacs&quot; theme, and later helped modify it to run on a
home-made openlase driven RGB laser projector.

The music, sound effects and voiceover
work is substantially my doing as well.</p>

<p>I recently presented a technique I came up with for generating somewhat
realistic looking gas giant planet graphics which looks better than anything
else I've seen out there (better than what's in Elite: Dangerous, for example)
